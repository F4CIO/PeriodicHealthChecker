# PeriodicHealthChecker
This tool periodically visits URL/HealthStatus.aspx page on remote server. Then it parses text string returned by remote server and if any error occurred or text string is not as expected e-mail alert is sent. See screenshoot and details here: http://www.f4cio.com/periodic-website-health-checker-pinger
